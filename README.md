Private Blockchain Address
==========================

PBA - encryped blockchain address only visible to the owner / sender and receiver.

Proposed anonimity feature : The Dark Blockchain / Private Blockchain Addresses


The Dark Blockchain.

It is possible to have a "Dark Blockchain" such that only the sender and receiver of coins can see unencrypted details of a transaction.

The advantage for anonymity in useing a Dark Blockchain is that it  would reduces the number of people who have access to information that a transaction has taken place and to what amounts are sent to which addresses.


To achieve this,  in the Dark Blockchain, the full blockchain is encrypted. It is also possible to have both encrypted addresses and normal addresses.
 

Currently the funds stored on the coin blockchains are unencrypted. The funds are to be encrypted with the new users address, as they are sent. The holder has the key to send the coins.

In the Dark Blockchain system it is proposed to have an extra level of encryption, so that only the owner or sender to the address has the key to view the address or the amount of coins in that address.

Currently when you look at the wallet you see all the amounts and addresses and you can go to a block chain viewer and see the same information.

In the Dark Blockchain, the web blockchain viewer will only show encrypted addresses and the amount of coins in that address will be also be encrypted.

The disadvantage of the Dark Blockchain is that only the sender and receiver are aware a transaction took place. Users are trusting that the software performed the required action, since no third party can look at the web blockchain viewer and confirm the transaction.

However, where crypto currencies have now established a high level of security and trust in open source code methods, it would now be possible to implement Dark Blockchain features.

It would be possible to allow Dark Blockchain addresses as an upgrade. Coins currently visible, could be sent to an encrypted address. The system is thus implementable in current coin blockchains. Users would then be able to choose to send coins to an encrypted Dark Blockchain addresses if they wished, as an option. You would obviously need the correct wallet to view your encrypted addresses and see what is in them.
