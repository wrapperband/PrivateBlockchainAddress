Private Blockchain Address
==========================

To describe / develop / prototype / test - encrypting coin addresses in the Blockchain.

PBA - encrypted blockchain address only visible to the owner / sender and receiver.

Proposed anonymity feature : The Dark Blockchain / Private Blockchain Addresses

Developing Private Blockchain addresses
---------------------------------------

The idea of developing PBA is to investigate whether it is possible to have a "Dark Blockchain" such that only the sender and receiver of coins can see unencrypted details of a transaction.

The white paper or functional requirement is currently being developed.

This is an open project to any contributor.
