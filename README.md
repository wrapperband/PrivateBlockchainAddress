Private Blockchain Addresses   
============================  
Proposed anonymity feature : The Dark Blockchain / Private Blockchain Addresses.  
PBA - encrypted blockchain address which are only visible to the owner / sender and receiver.  
  
Developing Private Blockchain addresses - ideology  
--------------------------------------------------  
> Blockchains are a way storing encrypted data. Current blockchains such as Bitcoins are psudo anonimous for various reasons but a major one is information leakage at transfer, and storage of plain addresses in the blockchain.  
> The idea of developing PBA is to investigate whether it is possible to have a "Dark Blockchain" such that only the sender and receiver of coins can see unencrypted details of a transaction.  
>  
> The white paper or functional requirement is currently being developed.  
>  
> This is an open project to any contributor.
