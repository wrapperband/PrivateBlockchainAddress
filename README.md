Private Blockchain Addresses
============================
Proposed anonymity feature : The Dark Blockchain / Private Blockchain Addresses. 
PBA - encrypted blockchain address which are only visible to the owner / sender and receiver.

To describe - develop - prototype - test - encrypting coin addresses in the Blockchain.

Developing Private Blockchain addresses
---------------------------------------
The idea of developing PBA is to investigate whether it is possible to have a "Dark Blockchain" such that only the sender and receiver of coins can see unencrypted details of a transaction.

The white paper or functional requirement is currently being developed.

This is an open project to any contributor.
