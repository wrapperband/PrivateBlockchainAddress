Private Blockchain Addresses (Dark Blockchain)

To describe / develop / prototype / test - encrypting coin addresses in the Blockchain.

The idea is that the "same" coin address is passed / viewed through different "encrypted keys" removing the leakage of private information to an outside observer. The wallet would search its normal open addresses in the blockchain, + it would search for the encrypted address of any private addresses. Your wallet would have the key to view the unencrypted private addresses in your wallet.

Only the sender owner and receiver will see the unencrypted amount and address in their wallet as their private address will be part of the multi-signature encryption of the address..

Initially it was envisaged that the address and amount of a designated private address would be encrypted in the blockchain. By using multi-signature and Public / Private key technology, you would pass that amount in the private address, to a public or private address based on the receivers preference. If sending to a public address is chosen the last address will be made public.


Possible further enhancements / problems

A facility to send a "viewing password / address" to another user to prove funds, may be required to make the system production ready.

A facility to make the private encrypted address be a "Vanity Address" : which would make the address owner fully public.

A facility to make only the address encrypted not the coin amount.

It would also be possible to have mining payouts to Dark Blockchain addresses, as an option ..

The encrypted address may need to conform to a standard format so the coin type can still be identified, or not?.
